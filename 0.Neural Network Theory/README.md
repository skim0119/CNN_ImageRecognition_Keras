# Important Theories behind Neural Network

1. Perceptron - 
    - It provides the fundamental ideas behind the neural network theory, and demonstrate mathematical meanings of neurons.
2. Activation Function -
    - One of the important portion of neuron is 'Myelin Sheath,' which decide whether or not the signal will pass to the next neuron.
    - Various activation functions tries to mimic this phenomenon, and some other functions helps to expand this concept to be more applicable.
3. Softmax -
    - Softmax function is a expansion of sigmoid function (binary classifier).
    - It is essential function for network that tries to classify a data to multiple labels.
    - It calculates the probability of a data belong to each class.
