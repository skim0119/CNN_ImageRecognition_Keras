# Deep Learning Practice

This repository contains IPython notebooks and some python codes that I used to practice deep learning and neural network.

* Read this in other language: [한국어](README.ko.md)

## Environment
- Python3.6
    - Check the requirement.txt
    - Use ``` $ pip install -r requirement.txt ``` to install packages.
    - It includes Keras deep learning package with TensorFlow backend.
    - Tensorflow with gpu can be install by replacing requirement.txt from tensorflow to tensorflow-gpu.
